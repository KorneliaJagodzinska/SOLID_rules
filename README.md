# SOLID
Repository contains examples for SOLID rules.

For each rule there are projects packed in packages:

com.amen.solid.[s,o,l,i,d]_[1,2,3].[bad,good]

Where:
- letters [s,o,l,i,d] represent each rule,
- numbers [1,2,3] represent number of example
- identifiers [bad,good] represent versions, each version of example has bad version (when principle is violated) and good version
